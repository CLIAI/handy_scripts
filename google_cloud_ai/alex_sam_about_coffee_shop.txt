**Alex**: Hey, Sam, did you hear about that new coffee shop that opened on Mars?

**Sam**: Oh yeah? What's the buzz about it?

**Alex**: Apparently, the atmosphere is out of this world, but there's just no filter!

**Sam**: Ha! Do they at least have decaf?

**Alex**: Only if you like your decaf with a side of zero gravity.

**Sam**: Well, I guess I'd have to be a "space-cial" customer to enjoy that!
