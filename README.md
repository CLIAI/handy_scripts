# handy_scripts

Collection of handy CLI AI scripts, experiments with AI (Dialogs)
to make them, and reasearchy notes.

If you like scripts so much, you can always add to PATH (e.g. .bashrc),
to have them always at hand in termianl :).

Maybe in future will update list of contents automatically,
now I hope that names will be self descriptive,
and script inside having enough descriptions.

Let me mention some:

* 2023-05-19 LLmsü§ñ nad Literate  Programming (üôèDonald Knuth) - ü§ùSynergy Potential,
  as similar to Chain-of-Thought:
    * [Literate Style Co-programming with GPT-4 as a Copilot: An Experiment and Study](pdfs/23/LLM_and_Literate_Programming/Literate_Programming_Experiment_with_GPT4.pdf) or  [markdown](openai_whisper_transcription.dialog.md),
    * [Produced Script](openai_whisper_transcription.sh) and produced [README.md](openai_whisper_transcription-README.md),
      - hopefully also handy e.g. to convert your brainstorming voice notes,
        or audio from video lectures for later LLM processing.
